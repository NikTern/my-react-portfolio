# React Portfolio

A responsive and dynamically generated React application for viewing my portfolio of work.

## Description

This project is a single-page React application that serves as a web developer's portfolio. The portfolio showcases my work and provides a way for potential employers to assess my skills and experience. The application contains sections for About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. The Portfolio section displays six projects with links to deployed applications and corresponding GitHub repositories.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
3. Run npm install to install all necessary dependencies.
4. Once the dependencies are installed, run npm start to start the development server and launch the application in your browser.

Alternatively, the app is deployed on GitHub pages: https://niktern.github.io/my-react-portfolio/ 

## Usage

When you load the portfolio, you will be presented with a header, a section for content, and a footer. The header contains my name and navigation links for different sections of the portfolio (About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume).

Click on a navigation title to view the corresponding section without the page reloading. The current section's title will be highlighted.

The About Me section displays a photoand a short bio. The Portfolio section showcases six projects. Each project has an image, a title, and links to the deployed application and corresponding GitHub repository.

The Contact section contains a contact form with fields for name, email address, and a message. When you click out of a form field without entering text, you'll receive a notification that the field is required. If you enter an invalid email address, you'll be notified it is invalid.

The Resume section provides a link to download the my resume and a list of skills. The footer includes text or icon links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as my profile on a third platform (Twitter).
